# Tagging

## Overview

theWrench uses tags to capture the versions of the assets as a whole.  Each asset logs the saves that have been done to it.  When accessing a single asset's save history, you can scroll through it much like an "Undo" and "Redo" functionality, but the history itself cannot be changed.  

Therefore, each time you save, you can still access the previous versions by simply clicking the back arrow ("Undo") as far back as you wish.

In the image below, we see that there are 10 different versions, and we are currently viewing the 10th (latest) version.
