## Overview  

A decision table resembles a spreadsheet and is used to specify the actions that are to be performed given certain conditions.

A decision table consists of input columns and output columns. Input columns (left side) define conditions, and output columns define actions (right side).  Each row is a complete set of conditions and actions.  When row inputs match, actions are produced for that row.

The same decision table can be used across as many flows as you wish.  

Decision table options are accessed on the table level, by clicking its ID in the top left corner of the screen.
