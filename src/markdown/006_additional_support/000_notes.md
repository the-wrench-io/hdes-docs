# Notes


When using theWrench, please keep the following items in mind:

* `CTRL + SPACE` is the most common keyboard shortcut you will use. Use it to add new elements or modify existing elements in your flow's code.
* Save frequently. Save each asset individually. Save is not global and applies only to the asset which you are currently working on.
* The browser's "back" button is not supported. Instead, navigate assets via the right-side menu.

* When creating a new decision table, set hit policy to FIRST. (The default is ALL).
* Setting a "catch-all" row in a decision table is a good way to catch logic holes and simplify tables at the same time.
* The `then:` keyword defaults to a value of `then: next`, which serves only to visually draw an arrow between flow tasks on the diagram. It does not link the tasks functionally.
* The blue text above a task is its description, not its ID. This description can be edited to enhance readability on the flow diagram without changing the ID of the item itself.
